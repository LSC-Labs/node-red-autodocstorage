    <p>Lock/Unlock a document for processing</p>
    The lock comes in place, to avoid multiple triggers on the same document.
    If an PDF file will be OCR parsed and enriched (later in the queue), it will be replaced. This would cause an unexpected trigger.
    To avoid this behaviour, the processing will stop, if a valid lock (lockfile) is in place.
    The lock file wil be stored at the same location as the file, with the extension ".lock".<br/>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    The node can lock, increment the lock or unlock a file.
    <ol>
        <li>Lock the file<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>If there is already a valid lockfile in place - the processing stops.</li>
                <li>If no lock is in place, the module tries to set the lock - the message will be sent on port 1.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Lock the file (increment)<br/>
            Sets (if no lock is in place) or increment the lock counter (if there is already a lock in place).
            In any case, the message will be sent on port 2.<br/>
            If you want to ensure multiple triggers form the same file, use "set the lock" instead.
        </li>
        <li>Unlock the file<br/>
            If there is a valid lockfile in place, the lock counter will be decremented.
            <ul>
                <li>If the lock counter becomes 0, the lockfile will be removed and the message will be send on port 2.</li>
                <li>If the lock counter is not 0, no message will be send, the processing stops.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Unlock the file (forced)<br/>
            Same as "Unlock the file", but not caring about the counter. The lock will be removed immediatly.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>The path to the document in a way, that it can be addressed and found.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <ol class="node-ports">
        <li >file locked<br/>
            The file was locked. Either by setting the lock the first time,
            and the lock comes in place, or by successfully incrementing the lock.
        </li>
        <li >file unlocked<br/>
            The file was unlocked, the lockfile was removed.
        </li>
        <li >no lock possible<br/>
            A lock could not set/removed... Reasons:
            <dl>
                <dt>Setting or incrementing the lock</dt>
                <dd>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you try to set the lock, but there is already a lock file in place.</li>
                        <li>If you try to set the lock, but there was an I/O error.</li>
                        <li>On incrementing the lock, the reason would be an I/O error.</li>
                        <li>On removing the lock, but there is no lockfile in place - or there was an I/O error.</li>
                    </ol>
                </dd>
                <dt>Removing the lock</dt>
                <dd>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you try to remove the lock, but there is no lockfile in place - or there was an I/O error.</li>
                    </ol>
                </dd>
            </dl>
            If an I/O error comes in place, please check the access rights of the node red user.
        </li>
        <li>not in scope<br/>
            The input file is not in scope of this node. Either the event type or the defined file extensions does not match.<br/>
            In this case, no action will be taken by this node.
        </li>
    </ol>
    In all cases, the sent Message will be forwarded and contains:
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>The input file name.</dd>
    </dl>
