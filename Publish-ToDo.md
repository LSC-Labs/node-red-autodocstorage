Adding to flows.nodered.org
As of April 2020, the the Node-RED Flow Library is no longer able to automatically index and update nodes published on npm with the node-red keyword. Instead, a submission request has to be placed manually.

To do so, make sure all of the packaging requests are met. To add a new node to the library, click on the + button at the top of the library’s page, and select the ‘node’ option. This button takes you to the Adding a Node page. Here, the list of requirements is repeated and describes the steps to have it added to the library.

To update an existing node, you can either resubmit it the same way as you would for a new node, or request a refresh from the node’s page on the flow library through the ‘request refresh’ link. This is only visible to logged in users.

If it does not appear after that time, you can ask for help on the Node-RED forum or slack.
