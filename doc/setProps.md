# Set Properties Node
Sets  properties (without scanning the content).

You are able to set information while on the flow path, like defaults. 

## Usage Examples
- Define Defaults, if some properties could not be set later, so you are sure they have a valid content in any case.
- Define Source information. You can have multiple input triggers for special users like all or privat - so the storage should reflect this.
- (Re)define a bunch of properties after detecting, that it is a special document - like financial data.

## Input
- No input is needed to set the properties.
